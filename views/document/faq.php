        What is qhojo?
    </div>
    <div class="subcontent">
        qhojo is a peer-to-peer renting service for small goods. Lenders can post their item for rent by suppling some item details, a daily rental rate, and a deposit value. Borrowers can reserve these items for a duration, meet the lender, and borrow away.

        What happens if the item I rent out never gets returned?
    </div>
    <div class="subcontent">
        If the item is not returned after the rental duration, the borrower (who signed a billing agreement with us) will be charged the full value of the item. This amount will be transferred to the lender.

        Do I have to rent my item out to the first person who requests it?
    </div>
    <div class="subcontent">
        Absolutely not. You can ignore a person's rental request if you're not comfortable renting your item to them.
