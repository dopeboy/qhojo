<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I>How the Site,
Application and Services Work</I></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Site,
Application and Services can be used to facilitate the listing and
rental of personal property ("Items"). Such Items are included in
"Listings" on the Site, Application and Services by Lenders. You
may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to the Site, Application
and Services; however, if you wish to book an Item or create a
Listing, you must first register to create a Qhojo Account (defined
below).</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As stated above,
Qhojo makes available a platform or marketplace with related
technology for Borrowers and Lenders to meet online and arrange for
rentals of Items. Qhojo does not own, sell, resell, furnish, provide,
rent, re-rent, manage and/or control Items. Qhojo's
responsibilities are limited to: (i) facilitating the availability of
the Site, Application and Services and (ii) serving as the limited
agent of each Lender for the purpose of accepting payments from
Borrowers on behalf of the Lender.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>PLEASE NOTE THAT, AS
STATED ABOVE, THE SITE, APPLICATION AND SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE
USED TO FACILITATE THE RENTAL OF ITEMS. QHOJO CANNOT AND DOES NOT
CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND THE CONDITION,
LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY ITEMS. QHOJO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR
AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS
AND ITEMS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY RENTALS WILL BE MADE AT THE LENDER'S
AND BORROWER'S OWN RISK.</FONT></FONT></P>

providing your Third Party Account login information to Qhojo through
the Site, Services or Application; or (ii) allowing Qhojo to access
your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms

Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all SNS Content, if any,
will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these
Terms. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject
to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party
Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your

Third Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or
Qhojo's access to such Third Party Account is terminated by the
third party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be
available on and through the Site, Services and Application. You have
the ability to disable the connection between your Qhojo Account and
your Third Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the "Settings"

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We will create your
Qhojo Account and your Qhojo Account profile page for your use of the
Site and Application based upon the personal information you provide
to us or that we obtain via an SNS as described above. You may not
have more than one (1) active Qhojo Account. You agree to provide
accurate, current and complete information during the registration
process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current
and complete. Qhojo reserves the right to suspend or terminate your

inaccurate, not current or incomplete. You are responsible for
safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your

responsibility for any activities or actions under your Qhojo

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Item Listings </B></FONT></FONT>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As a Member, you may
create Listings. To this end, you will be asked a variety of
questions about the Item to be listed, including, but not limited to,
the location, capacity, size, features, availability of the Item and
pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be
featured in Listings via the Site, Application and Services, all
Items must have valid physical addresses. Listings will be made
publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. Other
Members will be able to book your Items via the Site, Application and
Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You
understand and agree that once a Borrower requests a rental of your
Item, the price for such rental may not be altered.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>You acknowledge and
agree that you are responsible for any and all Listings you post.
Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and
the rental of an Item in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any
agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will
(a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and
rules and regulations that may apply to any Item included in a
Listing you post (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties.
Please note that Qhojo assumes no responsibility for a Lender's
compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations. Qhojo
reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove
or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings
that Qhojo, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for
any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the
Site, Application or Services.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>You understand and
agree that Qhojo does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent
for you as a Lender. If a Borrower requests a rental of your Item and
uses your Item, any agreement you enter into with such Borrower is
between you and the Borrower and Qhojo is not a party thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Qhojo serves as the limited authorized
agent of the Lender for the purpose of accepting payments from
Borrowers on behalf of the Lender and is responsible for transmitting
such payments to the Lender.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When you create a
Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which
must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a rental of
your Item, including, but not limited to, requiring Members to have a
profile picture or verified phone number, in order to book your Item.
Any Member wishing to book Items included in Listings with such
requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to
set such requirements is available via the "Lending" section of
the Site, Application and Services.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If you are a Lender,
Qhojo makes certain tools available to you to help you to make
informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm for
rental of your Item. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Lender, you
are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also
responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who use the
Item at your request or invitation, excluding the Borrower (and the
individuals the Borrower allows to use the Item, if applicable.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Qhojo recommends
that Lenders obtain appropriate insurance for their Items. Please
review any insurance policy that you may have for your Item
carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar
with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may
apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to,
whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or
inactions of Borrowers (and the individuals the Borrower invites to
use Item, if applicable) with respect to the Item.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>With regard to
damage, losses, or other liabilities, you acknowledge that any
personal insurance you have available to you (e.g., personal auto
insurance, insurance from credit cards, etc.) will be the primary
source of funds for your liabilities. Subject to the coverage and
protection available to you, you acknowledge that you are fully
responsible for any damage, losses or other liabilities relating to
your activities through the Site, Application and Services.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>No Endorsement</B></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Qhojo does not
endorse any Members or any Items. In addition, although these Terms
require Members to provide accurate information, we do not attempt to
confirm, and do not confirm, any Member's purported identity. You
are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of
others who you contact via the Site, Application and Services. We
will not be responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your
interactions with other Members.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>By using the Site,
Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability
that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or
other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular
Members or other third parties who caused you harm and you agree not
to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from
Qhojo with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we
encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site
and Services regarding any rentals or Listings made by you. This
limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Lender against Qhojo
regarding the remittance of payments received from a Borrower by
Qhojo on behalf of a Lender, which instead shall be subject to the
limitations described in the section below entitled "Limitation of
Liability".</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Prohibited Items</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<A NAME="_GoBack"></A>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Members may not
create Listings on the Site, Application or Services for any
"Prohibited Items."  Prohibited Items includes any weapon,
motorized vehicle (excluding lawnmowers and other gardening
equipment), any perishables (including food, beverages, and
medicines), any illegal or prohibited item, any item that requires
licensure for use, any item that the Lender or Borrowers is not
authorized to use, and any other inherently dangerous item.  Qhojo
retains the right to determine in its sole discretion whether or not
a given item is a Prohibited Item, and to remove that item's
listing.  Members listing Prohibited Items in contravention of the
foregoing shall be solely responsible for the consequences of such
listing, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Qhojo from any damages
or consequences resulting therefrom. </FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Rentals and
Financial Terms</B></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I>Rentals and
Financial Terms for Lenders</I></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If you are a Lender
and a rental is requested for your Item via the Site, Application or
Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the rental
within 24 hours of when the rental is requested (as determined by
Qhojo in its sole discretion) or the rental request will be
automatically cancelled. When a rental is requested via the Site,
Application and Services, we will share with you (i) the first and
last name of the Borrower who has requested the rental, (ii) a link
to the Borrower's Qhojo Account profile page, (iii) the names of
any members of an SNS with whom you are "friends" or associated
on the SNS if such individuals are also "friends" or associated
with the Borrower on such SNS, and (iv) an indication that the name
that the Borrower provided to Qhojo when the Borrower became a Member
matches the name that the Borrower provided to the SNSs to which the
Borrower has linked his or her Qhojo Account, so that you can view
such information before confirming or rejecting the rental. If you
are unable to confirm or decide to reject a rental of an Item within
such 24 hour period, any amounts collected by Qhojo for the requested
rental will be refunded to the applicable Borrower's credit card
and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released. When
you confirm a rental requested by a Borrower, Qhojo will send you an
email, text message or message via the Application confirming such
rental, depending on the selections you make via the Site,
Application and Services.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The fees displayed
in each Listing are comprised of the Item Fees (defined below) and
the Lender Fees (defined below.) Where applicable, Taxes may be
charged in addition to the Item Fees and Lender Fees. The Item Fees,
the Lender Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in
these Terms as the "</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Total
Fees</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>".
The amounts due and payable by a Lender solely relating to a Lender's
Item are the "</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Item
Fees</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>".
Please note that it is the Lender and not Qhojo which determines the
Item Fees. The Item Fee may include a cleaning fee, at the Lender's
discretion.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In consideration for
providing the Services, Qhojo charges a fee to Lenders based upon a
percentage of applicable Item Fees, herein referred to as the "</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Lender
Fees</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>".
The Lender Fees are added to the Item Fees to calculate the Total
Fees (which will also include applicable Taxes) displayed in the
applicable Listing. Qhojo will collect the Total Fees at the time of
rental confirmation (i.e. when the Borrower notifies Qhojo that the
Borrower has received the Item) and will initiate payment of the Item
Fees (less Lender Fees) to the Lender within 24 hours of when the
Borrower receives the applicable Item (except to the extent that a
refund is due to the Borrower).</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I>Appointment of
Qhojo as Payment Agent for Lender</I></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Each Lender hereby
appoints Qhojo as the Lender's limited agent solely for the purpose
of collecting payments made by Borrowers on behalf of the Lender.
Each Lender agrees that payment made by a Borrower to Qhojo shall be
considered the same as a payment made directly to the Lender and the
Lender will make the Item available to Borrower in the agreed upon
manner as if the Lender has received the Item Fees. Each Lender
agrees that, Qhojo may (i) permit the Borrower to cancel the rental
and (ii) refund to the Borrower that any portion of the Item Fees. 
In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the
Lender, Qhojo assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the
Lender.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Please note that
Qhojo does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings.
However, you acknowledge and agree that Qhojo reserves the right, in
its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for
the creation of Listings. Please note that Qhojo will provide notice
of any Listing fee collection via the Site, Application and Services,
prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><I>Rentals and
Financial Terms for Borrowers</I></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Lenders, not
Qhojo, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed rentals and
making available any Items reserved through the Site, Application and
Services. If you, as a Borrower, choose to enter into a transaction
with a Lender for the rental of an Item, you agree and understand
that you are entering into an agreement with the Lender and you agree
to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated
with such Item imposed by the Lender. You acknowledge and agree that
you, and not Qhojo, will be responsible for performing the
obligations of any such agreements, that Qhojo is not a party to such
agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations
hereunder, Qhojo disclaims all liability arising from or related to
any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding
the fact that Qhojo is not a party to the agreement between you and
the Lender, Qhojo acts as the Lender's payment agent for the
limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the
Lender. Upon your payment of amounts to Qhojo which are due to the
Lender, your payment obligation to the Lender for such amounts is
extinguished, and Qhojo is responsible for remitting such amounts,
less Qhojo's Fees, to the Lender. In the event that Qhojo does not
remit any such amounts to a Lender, such Lender will have recourse
only against Qhojo.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Listings for Items
will specify the Total Fees. As noted above, the Lender is required
to either confirm or reject the rental within 24 hours of when the
rental is requested (as determined by Qhojo in its sole discretion)
or the requested rental will be automatically cancelled. If a
requested rental is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable
Lender), any amounts collected by Qhojo will be refunded to such
Borrower, depending on the selections the Borrower makes via the Site
and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Borrower's
credit card will be released, if applicable.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>You agree to pay
Qhojo for the Total Fees for any rental requested in connection with
your Qhojo Account if such requested rentals are confirmed by the
applicable Lender. In order to establish a rental pending the
applicable Lender's confirmation of your requested rental, you
understand and agree that Qhojo, on behalf of the Lender, reserves
the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization
via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit
card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar
sum in the currency in which you are transacting ( e.g. one euro or
one British pound) to verify your credit card. Once Qhojo receives
confirmation of your rental from the applicable Lender, Qhojo will
collect the Security Deposit in accordance with the terms and
conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the

these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation
or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site

retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a
court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's
copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual
property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Qhojo are
each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a
plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or
representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Qhojo
otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more
than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form
of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph
is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute
Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the
preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will
survive any termination of these Terms.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Arbitration Rules
and Governing Law. The arbitration will be administered by the
American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for
Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect,
except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA
Rules are available at </FONT></FONT>http://www.adr.org/arb_med<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>
or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act
will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Arbitration Process.
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other
party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA
Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at
</FONT></FONT>http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>.
 The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney
licensed to practice law in the state of New York and will be
selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute
arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator
within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then
the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Arbitration Location
and Procedure. Unless you and Qhojo otherwise agree, the arbitration
will be conducted in New York County.  If your claim does not exceed
$10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis
of documents you and Qhojo submit to the arbitrator, unless you
request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is
necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing
will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the
arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange
of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature
of the arbitration.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Arbitrator's
Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame
specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include
the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator
based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award
damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of
Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages
for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award
declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and
only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the
claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will
be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the
extent provided under applicable law. Qhojo will not seek, and hereby
waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover,
attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fees. Your
responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator
fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your
claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Qhojo will pay all such
fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your
claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was
frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Changes.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification" section
above, if Qhojo changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after
the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent
changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us
written notice (including by email to </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>support@qhojo.com</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>)

you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and
Qhojo in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute
Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms
(or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>General</B></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The failure of Qhojo
to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute
a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver
of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing
and signed by a duly authorized representative of Qhojo. Except as
expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of
any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to
its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason
an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any
provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision
will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other
provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</FONT></FONT></P>

and email address, and other Personal Information is optional, like
your date of birth. We reserve the right to require address
confirmation for Items included in Listings. If we require such
confirmation, we will send a code via postal mail to the address
contained in a Listing and ask you to enter the code via the Site,
Application and Service in order to confirm the address of the Item
included in the applicable Listing. We use your Personal Information

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We collect Personal
Information in connection with your registration to join the Service.
You can register to join via the Site or Application by completing
the required forms.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>You can also
register to join by logging into online accounts you may have with
third party service providers (&quot;SNS&quot;)(e.g. Facebook); each
such account, a &quot;Third Party Account&quot;, via our Site or
Application as described below. As part of the functionality of the
Site, Service and Application, you may link your Qhojo Account with
Third Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third Party
Account login information to Qhojo through the Site, Service or
Application; or (ii) allowing Qhojo to access your Third Party
Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions
that govern your use of each Third Party Account. You represent that
you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login
information to Qhojo and/or grant Qhojo access to your Third Party
Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes
described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and
conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account
and without obligating Qhojo to pay any fees or making Qhojo subject
to any usage limitations imposed by the applicable SNS. If you decide
to register by logging into a Third Party Account via our Site or
Application, we will obtain the Personal Information you have
provided to the applicable SNS (such as your &quot;real&quot; name,
email address, profile picture, names of SNS friends, names of SNS
groups to which you belong, other information you make publicly
available via the applicable SNS and/or other information you
authorize Qhojo to access by authorizing the SNS to provide such
information) from your Third Party Accounts and use that information
to create your Qhojo Account and Qhojo Account profile page and you
will become a Member. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you
choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such
Third Party Accounts, you understand that by granting us access to
the Third Party Accounts, we will access, make available and store
(if applicable and as permitted by the SNS and authorized by you) the
information in your Third Party Accounts so that it is available on
and through your Qhojo Account on the Site, Service and Application.
If there is information about your &quot;friends&quot; or people with
whom you are associated in your Third Party Account, the information
we obtain about those &quot;friends&quot; or people with whom you are
associated, may also depend on the privacy settings such people have
with the applicable SNS.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We also collect the
other information that you provide as part of registration and the
administration and personalization of your Qhojo Account profile
(e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual
preferences or demographic information) (&quot;Non-Identifying
Information&quot;).</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We use your Personal
Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying
Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your
transactions, and administer your inquiries.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Certain
Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your
Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for
example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way
that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information
are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone
or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example,
your demographic information). We may combine your Personal
Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with
information collected from other  Qhojo Users (defined below) to
attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the
quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how
our Site, Application and Service are used. We may also use the
combined information without aggregating it to serve you
specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to
your preferences or restrictions.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We also use your
Personal Information to contact you with Qhojo newsletters, marketing

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Identity theft and
the practice currently known as &quot;phishing&quot; are of great
concern to Qhojo. Safeguarding information to help protect you from

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Overview</B></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Site,
Application and Service can be used to facilitate the listing and
rental of Items. “Listings” for such Items are made available via
the Site, Application and Service by Lenders. Listings posted by
Lenders, ratings and reviews of Lenders and Borrowers, and the
Profile Information (as defined below) of Lenders and Borrowers, are
visible to any Qhojo User.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Qhojo Members and
Users</B></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When you create a
Qhojo Account, we will set up a Qhojo Account profile page for you.
Your Qhojo Account profile page will include your first name and last
initial. You can select the other items of Personal Information that
you wish to be included in your Qhojo Account profile page –
including, but not limited to, a profile picture, a list of the SNS
groups to which you belong, a list of any of your SNS friends or
connections who are also Members of Qhojo, connections you have
established between your Account and any SNSs, and a biography and
links to your Listings, if applicable (together, your &quot;Profile
Information&quot;). We will display your Profile Information in your
Qhojo Account profile page publicly via the Site and Application,
and, with your prior permission, on third party sites. Any
information you choose to provide as part of your Profile Information
will be publicly visible to all Qhojo Users and consequently should
reflect how much you want other Qhojo Users to know about you. We
recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and
we encourage members to think carefully about what information about
themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and
revise your Profile Information at any time.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Listings</B></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If you post a
Listing, we may publish that Listing publicly via the Site and
Application and may enable third parties to publish your Listing on
their websites through the use of an HTML &quot;widget&quot;. We may
also display the geographical location of your Listing in the form of
a map so that potential Borrowers can see the general area and
neighborhood of your Listing, but your actual street address will not
be disclosed until you enter into a confirmed transaction with
another Member.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If you request to
make a rental via the Site, Application and Service, Qhojo will share
the following information about you with the applicable Lender: (i)
your first and last name, (ii) a link to your Qhojo Account profile
page, (iii) the names of any members of an SNS with whom you are
&quot;friends&quot; or associated on the SNS if such individuals are
also &quot;friends&quot; or associated with the Lender on such SNS,
and (iv) an indication that the name that you provided to Qhojo when
you became a Member matches the name that you provided to the SNSs to
which you have linked your Qhojo Account. All of this information
will enable the Lender to decide whether to confirm or reject your
rental. When a Lender confirms a rental we will share pieces of the
Lender's Identify Information, including, but not limited to, full
name, phone number, the Item's address and the Lender's email
address, with the applicable Borrower selected by the Lender and we
will share pieces of the Borrower's Identify Information with the
Lender, including, but not limited to, full name, phone number and
email address, so that the Borrower and Lender may contact one
another directly. In no event is a Borrower's Billing Information
shared with an Lender.</FONT></FONT></P>
